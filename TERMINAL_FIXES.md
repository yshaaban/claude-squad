# Terminal Rendering Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve terminal rendering issues in the Claude Squad React frontend.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Status Messages Mixed with Terminal Content**
   - Previously: Status messages like "Connecting to WebSocket..." were written directly to the terminal, cluttering the output
   - Fix: Added a dedicated status bar above the terminal that displays connection status without affecting terminal content

2. **Content Duplication**
   - Previously: Each reconnection or state change would cause content to be duplicated in the terminal
   - Fix: Implemented content hashing and tracking on both client and server to prevent duplicate content

3. **Terminal Sizing Issues**
   - Previously: Terminal dimensions were sometimes incorrect, causing display errors
   - Fix: Added proper dimension checking before fitting the terminal, and improved resize handling

4. **Excessive Polling**
   - Previously: Server was polling for terminal content every 100ms, causing high traffic
   - Fix: Reduced polling frequency to 250ms and added proper content hashing to prevent redundant updates

## Implementation Details

### Terminal Component Improvements (`Terminal.tsx`)

1. **Status Management**
   - Added a status bar above the terminal to show connection state
   - Status messages are color-coded based on type (info, warning, error, success)
   - Status updates no longer clutter the terminal output

2. **Content Deduplication**
   - Added a hash-based content tracking system that identifies and skips duplicate content
   - Limited hash storage to prevent memory issues (only keeps the most recent 100 hashes)
   - Applied deduplication to both binary and JSON protocol messages

3. **Terminal Initialization**
   - Improved terminal initialization with proper dimension handling
   - Added safety checks to ensure the container has dimensions before fitting
   - Used requestAnimationFrame and delayed initialization for better reliability

4. **Reconnection Logic**
   - Implemented proper exponential backoff with jitter for reconnections
   - Added content hash reset on new connections to ensure fresh start
   - Limited maximum reconnection attempts to prevent resource exhaustion

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Added Ctrl+L keyboard shortcut for clearing the terminal
   - Implemented proper clear terminal communication with the server

### Server-Side Improvements (`terminal.go`)

1. **Content Deduplication**
   - Added SHA-256 hashing of terminal content to detect duplicates
   - Implemented a time-based cleanup mechanism to prevent unbounded growth
   - Reduced polling frequency from 100ms to 250ms

2. **Initial Content Handling**
   - Now sends initial content immediately on connection
   - Properly registers the initial content in the hash tracking system

3. **Clear Terminal Support**
   - Added support for clear terminal commands from the client
   - Server acknowledges clear commands for proper synchronization

## Usage

The terminal now provides a much cleaner experience:

1. Connection status is shown in a dedicated status bar
2. Terminal output is clean without status messages
3. Content is not duplicated on reconnection
4. Terminal can be cleared with Ctrl+L keyboard shortcut

## Testing

To test these improvements, run:

```bash
./cs_test -s --web --web-port 8085 --react --log-to-file
```

Then open a browser to http://localhost:8085/ and try the following:

1. Reload the page - notice no duplicate content appears
2. Press Ctrl+L to clear the terminal
3. Observe the status bar updating with connection state changes

These improvements significantly enhance the terminal experience in the React frontend.
