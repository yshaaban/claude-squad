TERMINAL VISIBILITY TEST INSTRUCTIONS

This document contains instructions for testing the terminal visibility in the web UI.

1. Start Claude Squad with web monitoring enabled:
   ./cs -s --web

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:8099/

3. Open the browser developer console (F12 or right-click -> Inspect -> Console)

4. Copy and paste the entire contents of the test-terminal-visibility.js file into the console and press Enter.

5. The script will run a series of checks and report if the terminal is visible and has content.

6. If the terminal is not visible (black box), the script will try to:
   - Switch to fallback mode
   - Verify if the fallback terminal is displaying content

7. Check the console output for:
   - SUCCESS messages: Terminal is working correctly
   - WARNING messages: Potential issues that might need attention
   - ERROR messages: Critical problems that need to be fixed

TROUBLESHOOTING

If the script reports errors:

1. Try manually clicking the "Use Fallback" button to switch to plain text mode.

2. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.

3. Try a different browser to rule out browser-specific issues.

4. Make sure the tmux session for the Claude instance is running correctly.

5. Check the server logs for any WebSocket connection errors.
