# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Initial Fixes Applied
1. Added standard WebSocket ping/pong handlers with read deadlines in server code
2. Added proper resize command handling in server code
3. Removed custom binary close messaging in frontend
4. Verified that TerminalInput struct already had Cols and Rows fields

## Additional Fixes For Instance Lifecycle Management

### Server-Side Fixes
1. **Context-Based Goroutine Management**: Implemented proper context propagation to coordinate goroutine shutdown
   - Added `context.WithCancel` for all goroutines in the handler
   - Ensured all goroutines have a way to terminate when context is cancelled

2. **Instance Validity Checking**: Added robust instance lifecycle validation
   - Periodically check if the instance still exists (every 5 seconds)
   - Mark instance as invalid when it no longer exists in storage
   - Send termination notification to client when instance becomes invalid

3. **Write Deadline Management**: Added proper write deadlines to prevent blocking WebSocket writes
   - Set appropriate timeouts for all WebSocket write operations
   - Added context-aware timeout handling for initial content sending

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for common WebSocket issues
   - Added more detailed error logging
   - Improved response handling for common errors
   - Added proper write mutex protections

5. **Reconnection Prevention**: Prevented reconnection attempts when instance no longer exists
   - Added notification messages to inform clients about permanent termination
   - Improved close message handling

6. **Fixed Syntax Errors**: Corrected declaration order issues to prevent compilation errors
   - Moved mutex declaration (`writeMu`) to ensure it's defined before first use
   - Ensures proper thread safety across all goroutines
   - Fixed compilation errors in WebSocket handler

### Client-Side Fixes

1. **WebSocket Reference Management**: Used `useRef` instead of `useState` for WebSocket management
   - Prevents reconnection cycles due to React render loops
   - Maintains stable reference to WebSocket connection

2. **Instance Termination Handling**: Added client-side handling for instance termination events
   - Added explicit handlers for `instance_terminated` message type
   - Added handling for error responses related to missing instances
   - Prevented automatic reconnection for permanently terminated instances
   - Added clear user feedback for terminated instances

3. **Improved Error Handling and Reporting**: Enhanced user-facing error messages
   - Added more detailed error displays in UI
   - Added terminal output for critical errors 
   - Improved error logging

## Benefits
These fixes significantly improve WebSocket connection stability in several ways:

1. **Graceful Termination**: Proper cleanup of resources when instances or connections terminate
2. **Reduced Race Conditions**: Better synchronization between client and server component lifecycles
3. **Improved Error Recovery**: More robust handling of common failure modes
4. **Better User Feedback**: Clear messaging about connection and instance state
5. **Reduced Resource Leaks**: Proper closing of WebSocket connections and goroutines

The fixes also follow standard WebSocket best practices by using:
- Standard ping/pong mechanism
- Proper connection timeout handling
- JSON for all messaging
- Context-based concurrency management
