# WebSocket Connection Fixes (Final)

This document outlines the final set of modifications made to fix WebSocket connection issues in Claude Squad.

## 1. Terminal.tsx Improvements

### Fixed Terminal Recreation on Reconnect
- Removed `connected` from the effect dependency array
- Added `isMounted` flag to prevent state updates after unmount
- Enhanced cleanup to prevent memory leaks

```javascript
// Removed 'connected' from dependencies to prevent terminal recreation on reconnect
}, [instanceName, updateStatus, sendResize, clearTerminal, log, attemptFitAndResize])
```

## 2. Server-Side Improvements

### Added Panic Recovery to All Goroutines

Added panic recovery to all WebSocket goroutines:
- Instance validity checker
- Initial update sender
- Read-write handler
- Ping handler
- Update loop

```go
// Sample panic recovery pattern added to all goroutines
defer func() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
        log.FileOnlyErrorLog.Printf("WebSocket: PANIC in goroutine for '%s': %v\n%s", 
            instanceTitle, r, debug.Stack())
        // Signal other goroutines to terminate
        cancel()
    }
}()
```

### Improved Resource Management
- Added context cancellation checks to prevent operations after shutdown
- Enhanced error handling for connection errors
- Added proper mutex handling for thread safety
- Improved cleanup and resource release

## 3. Connection Architecture

The connection architecture now follows these principles:
1. Terminal connects to WebSocket and fits to its container
2. Terminal remains stable across reconnections (not recreated)
3. Client sends proper terminal dimensions after resize
4. Server validates instances regularly for availability
5. All goroutines have panic recovery and proper cleanup

## How to Apply These Fixes

These fixes have already been implemented in:
- `/frontend/src/components/terminal/Terminal.tsx`
- `/web/handlers/websocket.go`

## Testing

To test the stability improvements:
1. Run `cs -s --web --react`
2. Open the application in a browser
3. Test multiple resize operations
4. Test connection stability by temporarily disabling network
5. Test terminal content rendering
