# WebSocket Connection Fixes (Final)

This document outlines the final set of modifications made to fix WebSocket connection issues in Claude Squad.

## 1. Terminal.tsx Improvements

### Fixed Terminal Recreation on Reconnect
- Removed `connected` from the effect dependency array
- Added `isMounted` flag to prevent state updates after unmount
- Enhanced cleanup to prevent memory leaks

```javascript
// Removed 'connected' from dependencies to prevent terminal recreation on reconnect
}, [instanceName, updateStatus, sendResize, clearTerminal, log, attemptFitAndResize])
```

### Improved Terminal Initialization
- Properly open terminal before storing in state
- Added robust dimension validation and resize handling

```javascript
// Important: Open terminal BEFORE storing it in state
if (terminalRef.current) {
  term.open(terminalRef.current)
  updateStatus('Initializing terminal...')
}

// THEN store terminal instance in state
setTerminal(term)
```

## 2. Server-Side Improvements

### Added Panic Recovery to All Goroutines

Added panic recovery to all WebSocket goroutines:
- Instance validity checker
- Initial update sender
- Read-write handler
- Ping handler
- Update loop

```go
// Sample panic recovery pattern added to all goroutines
defer func() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
        log.FileOnlyErrorLog.Printf("WebSocket: PANIC in goroutine for '%s': %v\n%s", 
            instanceTitle, r, debug.Stack())
        // Signal other goroutines to terminate
        cancel()
    }
}()
```

### Improved Resource Management
- Added context cancellation checks to prevent operations after shutdown
- Enhanced error handling for connection errors
- Added proper mutex handling for thread safety
- Improved cleanup and resource release

### Fixed Syntax Issues
- Fixed mutex declaration order to ensure it's defined before first use
- Ensured thread safety with proper mutex placement

```go
// Mutex for websocket writes - declared early as it's used in multiple goroutines
var writeMu sync.Mutex
```

## 3. Connection Architecture

The connection architecture now follows these principles:
1. Terminal connects to WebSocket and fits to its container
2. Terminal remains stable across reconnections (not recreated)
3. Client sends proper terminal dimensions after resize
4. Server validates instances regularly for availability
5. All goroutines have panic recovery and proper cleanup

## How to Apply These Fixes

These fixes have been implemented in:
- `/frontend/src/components/terminal/Terminal.tsx`
- `/web/handlers/websocket.go`

You can apply them using the `clean_fix.sh` script which:
1. Creates backups of the original files
2. Applies the Terminal.tsx fixes
3. Properly handles the mutex declaration in websocket.go
4. Rebuilds the application

## Testing

To test the stability improvements:
1. Run `cs -s --web --react`
2. Open the application in a browser
3. Test multiple resize operations
4. Test connection stability by temporarily disabling network
5. Test terminal content rendering

## Verification

After applying these fixes, WebSocket connections should:
- Maintain stability over long periods
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Properly resize terminals when windows are resized
- Show no errors related to dimensions or undefined references
- Not create infinite reconnection loops
